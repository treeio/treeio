Installation on Ubuntu or Debian with MySQL
================================

Although you can install on most any UNIX system very easily, debian based distros are easier due to their package management.

You can also install on Max OSX or with other databases aside from MySQL very easily.


Install any dependencies
------------------------

1.  Update your local cache `sudo apt-get update`
1.  Upgrade your system `sudo apt-get upgrade` (Recommended but optional)
1.  `sudo apt-get install python build-essential python-dev`
1.  `sudo apt-get build-dep python-lxml python-imaging`
1.  `sudo apt-get install git python-flup python-pip`


Install services (In Production)
------------------------

1.  Install database `sudo apt-get install mysql-server` (Aside from MySQL you can also use Postgre, SQLite or OracleDB)
1.  Install web server `sudo apt-get install nginx` 

Alternatively you can use Apache, see this [community post](http://tree.io/en/community/questions/186/treeio-with-wsgi-for-apache-deploy) for an example configuration.

Create a clone of this repository
------------------------

1.  Clone the repo by running: `git clone https://github.com/treeio/treeio.git`
1.  Install dependencies: `sudo pip install -r requirements.pip`
1.  Run the patch: `python related_fields_patch.py`


Install the database (Example showing MySQL)
------------------------

    $ mysql -u treeio -ptreeio
           > create database treeio;
           > grant all privileges on treeio.* to treeio@localhost identified by 'treeio';
           > \q

1.  Install python mysql driver: `sudo apt-get install python-mysqldb`
1.  Install your database: `python manage.py installdb`
1.  Setup initial data: `python manage.py loaddata data.json` or if using mysql: `mysql -u treeio -ptreeio treeio < sql/mysql-treeio-current.sql`

Test install 
------------------------

1.  Run the built-in Django server `python manage.py runserver`
1.  In your browser go to `http://localhost:8000`
1.  Log in using username: `admin` and password: `admin`
1.  Profit!

Next steps (In Production)
