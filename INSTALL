Installation
============

1. Prerequisites
================
    
    Tree.io needs a bunch of Python modules, but you probably
    don't need to worry with that - it'll build most of them.

    Although you need to make sure you've got a few things for
    Tree.io to compile some of the modules. Specifically, we need
    to have all the requirements for lxml and PIL (Python Imaging
    Library).

    On a Debian-based systems you can simply do::

        sudo apt-get install build-essential python-dev
        sudo apt-get build-dep python-lxml python-imaging

    On other systems you'll need to get a compiler (usually gcc),
    Python headers and all the requirements for lxml and PIL.

2. Building models
==================

    Once you have all the prerequisites, just run ::
    
        make

3. Setting up database
======================

    First, you need to create a database for Tree.io

    With MySQL, it's usually something like this ::

        $ mysql -u username -p
        > create database database_name;
        > grant all privileges on database_name.* to some_user@localhost identified by 'some_password';
        > \q

    For other database systems refer to the relevant documentation.

    To install the database, just run ::

        make install

    If your setup is correct, it should install everything into the database for you.

    The default username and password is 'admin' / 'admin'


4. Launching Tree.io
====================

    You can try Tree.io by running::

        python manage.py runserver

    Then just go to http://localhost:8000/

    Please refer to Django docs on how to set up Tree.io to run behind Apache or Nginx.
    There's a friendly fcgi script and an example nginx config.
